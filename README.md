# car-price-drivers
This project aims to provide clear recommendations to my client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

# Summary of Findings
Based on the analysis of the data and predictions by multiple regression models, the features in used cars that customers value the most are:
1. Model Year: The most crucial feature in used cars is the model year.  Newer model used cars are priced better than older ones.
2. Odometer Reading: This is the second most important feature that customers value.  Higher mileage impacts used car prices negatively.
3. Automatic Transmission: Surprisingly, automatic transmission may impact customer's decisions and used car prices.  However, this indicator may not be as reliable as other features.
4. Fuel Type:  Used cars with diesel fuel generally sell better than those with other type of fuel
5. Drive type: Used cars with forward drive type may not sell very well.  However, this indicator may also not be as accurate as other features as it has a high degree of variability.
6. Car type:  Sedans do not hold their value very well.  In contrast, trucks generally hold their value much better than sedans.
7. The color Black seems to be the most popular in used cards, followed by white.
